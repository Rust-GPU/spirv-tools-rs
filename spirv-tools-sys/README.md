This crate is an unofficial wrapper for [SPIR-V Tools], its primary use case is for the [rust-gpu] project.

## Status

This is a very rough wrapper around the assembler, validator, and (most of the) optimizer tools available from [SPIR-V Tools], which is enough for the current needs of the [rust-gpu] project. See that project's code for more thorough usage examples.
